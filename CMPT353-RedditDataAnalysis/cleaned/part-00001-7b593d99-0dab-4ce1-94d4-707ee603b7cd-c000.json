{"author":"HoboViking","body":"Hey! \n\nI am so glad to see someone else doing this. I did it for my Dad before he passed, and it is something that my entire family cherishes to this day... and have since done it for 15 other people.\n\nA few suggestions:\n\n* Make sure your subject does 90% of the talking, and you do only 10%.  \n\n* If your subject moves away from your subject onto something else about their life, let them do it, don't correct them. Their life is more important than some of your questions. Prioritize the questions you need vs the ones you want.\n\n* Avoid things that will bring up bad memories. You want the subject to enjoy the interview, not feel worn out.  The better they feel the more you will get.  \n\n* Contact some of their life long friends and ask for things you should talk about. Things like nicknames, funny stories, how they met, etc.\n\n* Get some pictures, in frames, and place them behind your subject. At the same time, have some you can show the subject to bring up interesting stories that they may otherwise forget. Try to get photos they dont see all the time.\n\n* Provide them with water in case they get thirsty.\n\n* When they are tired, stop. \n\nAs for questions, ask yourself what you are hoping to get out of the interview. Do you want to know more about the subjects life, your life, your families history, world history, etc. (It sounds like you know what you want, but still think about it), and from there select questions and prioritize.\n\nI like asking questions about what they remember about their grandparents, or even great-grandparents.  Ask them about their first memories, their childhood toys, their family gatherings, school memories, first jobs, what their favorite movies were.\n\nThere are hundreds of oral history questions available online via google. Every interview I've done since my Dads Ive gone over google and grabbed ones Ive liked to supplement ones I come up with.\n\nWhen you're done, take a photo of your subject holding that days newspaper. In your spare time, transcribe the video interview so that you will have a written account of the interview in case you happen to lose the digital version.  I always place that last photo on top of the document.\n\nGood luck, and ask me questions if you have any.","timestamp":"2011-09-04T15:17:55.000-07:00","score":10,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":10,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

{"author":"jdh30","body":"&gt; This is the hard part. Knowing when the type the system has inferred is principal or not is very difficult. In the general case, it's probably impossible in the context of Scala. You'd have to carefully define a type system that infers HM types only when those types are also principal types. I have no idea how you'd go about doing this.\n\nOr you make the programmer annotate the code as being ML/non-ML.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, F# infers more types. But it infers non-principal types according to an informal algorithmic description of the type system.\n\n&gt; &gt; Can you give examples of what you mean? All I can think of is ad-hoc polymorphism resorting to int when it just saw +.\n\n&gt; Sure. Here's an example that uses neither subtyping nor overloading. You'll notice that f has type Foo[T] -&gt; Int and g has type Foo[T] -&gt; T. Neither type is more general than the other, hence there is no principal type for this function (despite its simplicity):\n\nMy Scala-fu isn't up to understanding your example. If `g` returns the `int` argument `i` of `InFoo` then surely it must return an `int` and not a `T`?\n\nHowever, for your example to make sense in this context we need a translation to F# where it infers a non-principal type but I do not see how F# can express this.\n","timestamp":"2011-03-12T11:05:01.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":6}

{"author":"nonamejoe","body":"Ok, looks like Baden-Baden is a fairly large city, formerly called just Baden, and from my cursory research it appears Baden-Baden was not bombed during WWII, which means there is a great chance that civil or church records exist of your ancestors.  Now, to find them.  \n\nFirst, are you sure your ancestor was from Baden-Baden specifically, or could it have been one of the small villages that surround Baden-Baden?  We need to be as precise as possible with our information, or you'll just be going on a wild goose chase.  If it is Baden-Baden, the Mormon church has a large microfilm database of different records from this town.  [Here.](https://familysearch.org/search/search/library_catalog#searchType=catalog&amp;filtered=true&amp;collectionId=&amp;fed=false&amp;page=1&amp;catSearchType=place&amp;searchCriteria=&amp;placeName=Germany,+Baden&amp;author_givenName=&amp;author_surname=&amp;uri=http%3A//catalog-search-api%3A8080/www-catalogapi-webservice/search%3Fquery%3Dsubject_id%3A385919%26count%3D50)  Once you decide which films you want to use, go [here](https://familysearch.org/locations) to find a FamilySearch center near you.  Then you can order films from them. Note that the films are $5.50 per film to rent, so thoroughly research which you want to look at first.\n\nAlternatively, you could look in this online database from the LDS FamilySearch site.  [Here](https://www.familysearch.org/search/collection/show#uri=http://hr-search-api:8080/searchapi/search/collection/1395660).  It looks like they are trying to get a lot of their microfilms searchable online, but they're not quite there yet.  This is the method I used to trace my relatives back to Poland.  I hope you have as much luck as I did.  \n\nOther ideas that grandpa might find interesting.  Have you found the immigration manifest from your ancestors??  If so, do a little research on the ship.  You may find a nice picture or even an advertisement of the ship from back in the late 1800s.  Your grandfather may enjoy that.  Also, if the ship arrived in New York, there were often blurbs in the New York times about the ship (if there were famous people aboard, how long it took, how many were travelling, etc).  You can search their archives for these.\n\nI'm sure we can come up with some more ideas as you research, so just message me.  I figure I've given you enough to go through for now.\n\nP.S.  I've only used ancestry.com for research in the United States, so I am unfamiliar with its effectiveness in International research.\n\nHappy hunting.","timestamp":"2011-04-03T11:39:18.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}
{"author":"KanaNebula","body":"Ancestry.com is an awesome resource.  It can add up quickly, but you will find that they definitely have done the work to deserve your money (if you've ever tried to do genealogy work in an actual archive vs. a company that has digitalized countless records... yeah it helps the process).  \n\nIf you don't know German though, if you are trying to decipher those records you may run into trouble.  And there is less international stuff.   Still, even in the last few years since your genealogy guy looked there are probably tons of records that he hasn't found (ancestry.com has been adding a lot of stuff).  Also, definitely browse message boards and post there.  I've had a lot of luck finding distant relatives through those! There is a 14 day trial, and honesty you should could just do that and run full force on this project for that time.  You can cancel your account and pay nothing.\n\nOn that note, it is still a long process.  I've been working on genealogy stuff for about 5 years and it will definitely be a life process!  One thing I really encourage you to do is ask your Grandpa about what he knows now.  Not only will this help in your search now, it will help keep those stories for future generations.","timestamp":"2011-04-03T23:01:59.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

Of course, we could speculate reasons for why inconsistent information could have been provided, but I've seen no reason so far to doubt the accuracy of the individual census information. While it's extremely tempting to assume that the 1850 Daniel is the one, it just seems speculative. \n\nThanks very much for providing this.

{"author":"sockthepuppetry","body":"I think the reason I was able to retrieve the article earlier was that I was at school, probably getting it through their subscription.  Try [this link](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Pinker-t.html).  Here's the text, anyway.\n\n*Have you ever wondered why there are so many kinds of mustard but only one kind of ketchup? Or what Cézanne did before painting his first significant works in his 50s? Have you hungered for the story behind the Veg-O-Matic, star of the frenetic late-night TV ads? Or wanted to know where Led Zeppelin got the riff in “Whole Lotta Love”?*\n\n*Neither had I, until I began this collection by the indefatigably curious journalist Malcolm Gladwell. The familiar jacket design, with its tiny graphic on a spare background, reminds us that Gladwell has become a brand. He is the author of the mega-best sellers “The Tipping Point,” “Blink” and “Out­liers”; a popular speaker on the Dilbert circuit; and a prolific contributor to The New Yorker, where the 19 articles in “What the Dog Saw” were originally published. This volume includes prequels to those books and other examples of Gladwell’s stock in trade: counterintuitive findings from little-known experts.*\n\n*A third of the essays are portraits of “minor geniuses” — impassioned oddballs loosely connected to cultural trends. We meet the feuding clan of speed-talking pitchmen who gave us the Pocket Fisherman, Hair in a Can, and other it-slices!-it-dices! contraptions. There is the woman who came up with the slogan “Does she or doesn’t she?” and made hair coloring (and, Gladwell suggests, self-invention) respectable to millions of American women. The investor Nassim Taleb explains how markets can be blindsided by improbable but consequential events. A gourmet ketchup entrepreneur provides Gladwell the opportunity to explain the psychology of taste and to recount the history of condiments.*\n\n*Another third are on the hazards of statistical prediction, especially when it comes to spectacular failures like Enron, 9/11, the fatal flight of John F. Kennedy Jr., the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the persistence of homelessness and the unsuccessful targeting of Scud missile launchers during the Persian Gulf war of 1991. For each debacle, Gladwell tries to single out a fallacy of reasoning behind it, such as that more information is always better, that pictures offer certainty, that events are distributed in a bell curve around typical cases, that clues available in hindsight should have been obvious before the fact and that the risk of failure in a complex system can be reduced to zero.*\n\n*The final third are also about augury, this time about individuals rather than events. Why, he asks, is it so hard to prognosticate the performance of artists, teachers, quarterbacks, executives, serial killers and breeds of dogs?*\n\n***The themes of the collection are a good way to characterize Gladwell himself: a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning and who occasionally blunders into spectacular failures.***\n\n*Gladwell is a writer of many gifts. His nose for the untold back story will have readers repeatedly muttering, “Gee, that’s interesting!” He avoids shopworn topics, easy moralization and conventional wisdom, encouraging his readers to think again and think different. His prose is transparent, with lucid explanations and a sense that we are chatting with the experts ourselves. Some chapters are master­pieces in the art of the essay. I particularly liked “Something Borrowed,” a moving examination of the elusive line between artistic influence and plagiarism, and “Dangerous Minds,” a suspenseful tale of criminal profiling that shows how self-anointed experts can delude their clients and themselves with elastic predictions.*\n\n*An eclectic essayist is necessarily a dilettante, which is not in itself a bad thing. But Gladwell frequently holds forth about statistics and psychology, and his lack of technical grounding in these subjects can be jarring. He provides misleading definitions of “homology,” “sagittal plane” and “power law” and quotes an expert speaking about an “igon value” (that’s eigenvalue, a basic concept in linear algebra). In the spirit of Gladwell, who likes to give portentous names to his aperçus, **I will call this the Igon Value Problem: when a writer’s education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong.***\n\n*The banalities come from a gimmick that can be called the Straw We. First Gladwell disarmingly includes himself and the reader in a dubious consensus — for example, that “we” believe that jailing an executive will end corporate malfeasance, or that geniuses are invariably self-made prodigies or that eliminating a risk can make a system 100 percent safe. He then knocks it down with an ambiguous observation, such as that “risks are not easily manageable, accidents are not easily preventable.” As a generic statement, this is true but trite: of course many things can go wrong in a complex system, and of course people sometimes trade off safety for cost and convenience (we don’t drive to work wearing crash helmets in Mack trucks at 10 miles per hour). But as a more substantive claim that accident investigations are meaningless “rituals of reassurance” with no effect on safety, or that people have a “fundamental tendency to compensate for lower risks in one area by taking greater risks in another,” it is demonstrably false.*\n\n*The problem with Gladwell’s generalizations about prediction is that **he never zeroes in on the essence of a statistical problem and instead overinterprets some of its trappings.** For example, in many cases of uncertainty, a decision maker has to act on an observation that may be either a signal from a target or noise from a distractor (a blip on a screen may be a missile or static; a blob on an X-ray may be a tumor or a harmless thickening). Improving the ability of your detection technology to discriminate signals from noise is always a good thing, because it lowers the chance you’ll mistake a target for a distractor or vice versa. But given the technology you have, there is an optimal threshold for a decision, which depends on the relative costs of missing a target and issuing a false alarm. By failing to identify this trade-off, Gladwell bamboozles his readers with pseudoparadoxes about the limitations of pictures and the downside of precise information.*\n\n*Another example of an inherent trade-off in decision-making is the one that pits the accuracy of predictive information against the cost and complexity of acquiring it. Gladwell notes that I.Q. scores, teaching certificates and performance in college athletics are imperfect predictors of professional success. This sets up a “we” who is “used to dealing with prediction problems by going back and looking for better predictors.” Instead, Gladwell argues, “teaching should be open to anyone with a pulse and a college degree — and teachers should be judged after they have started their jobs, not before.”*\n\n*But this “solution” misses the whole point of assessment, which is not clairvoyance but cost-effectiveness. To hire teachers indiscriminately and judge them on the job is an example of “going back and looking for better predictors”: the first year of a career is being used to predict the remainder. It’s simply the predictor that’s most expensive (in dollars and poorly taught students) along the accuracy-­cost trade-off. Nor does the absurdity of this solution for professional athletics (should every college quarterback play in the N.F.L.?) give Gladwell doubts about his misleading analogy between hiring teachers (where the goal is to weed out the bottom 15 percent) and drafting quarterbacks (where the goal is to discover the sliver of a percentage point at the top).*\n\n*The common thread in Gladwell’s writing is a kind of populism, which seeks to undermine the ideals of talent, intelligence and analytical prowess in favor of luck, opportunity, experience and intuition. For an apolitical writer like Gladwell, this has the advantage of appealing both to the Horatio Alger right and to the egalitarian left. Unfortunately he wildly overstates his empirical case. It is simply not true that a quarter­back’s rank in the draft is uncorrelated with his success in the pros, that cognitive skills don’t predict a teacher’s effectiveness, that intelligence scores are poorly related to job performance or (the major claim in “Outliers”) that above a minimum I.Q. of 120, higher intelligence does not bring greater intellectual achievements.*\n\n*The reasoning in “Outliers,” which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle. Fortunately for “What the Dog Saw,” the essay format is a better showcase for Gladwell’s talents, because the constraints of length and editors yield a higher ratio of fact to fancy. Readers have much to learn from Gladwell the journalist and essayist. But when it comes to Gladwell the social scientist, they should watch out for those igon values.*\n\nEmphasis added by me.","timestamp":"2011-02-21T19:09:57.000-08:00","score":5,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":5,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":1}

Type Erasure is huge on my list. \n\nBut in my personal belief, one of the reason why PHP is so popular, other than it was one of the first purpose built language for web domain, is it's simplicity. I know people that's aren't CS major that code PHP for a living. And Kotlin takes keeps the C syntax and doesn't have the function hybrid so it's easy to pick up. And not only that, the IDE is probably going to be amazing. \n\nKotlin is only in its infancy so it's not fair to judge it yet. We haven't seen any real code, library, etc.. of it yet. Only time will tell which one will be the victor.\n\nHell they might not even compete if they target different problem domain to solve.\n\nBut if it's going to try to compete with Scala in concurrency then it's probably going to lose, Akka and Scala is teaming up, but if it manage to find a domain that it can solve and specialize in, oh boy...\n\n","timestamp":"2011-07-23T00:52:42.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"scala","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":6}

{"author":"ParanoydAndroid","body":"I think the other poster is being too literal in his interpretation.  In the comic, the hotels are the object of consideration, even though they aren't public goods.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons is, essentially, about how everyone working together can have something good, one guy working selfishly can have something even better, and everyone being selfish means they end up with nothing.\n\nWith the hotel, intheory good hotels should be encouraged by having business funneled their way.  In theory, this would promote the survival of the hotel with the appropriate traits while causing bad hotels to go out of business.  Thus leaving an appropriate review is the cooperative action, and if everyone takes it then they get a better world (theoretically a world with more good hotels and fewer bad hotels).\n\nBy defecting, black hat guy is giving himself something even better (a good hotel for cheap) while harming others.\n\nIf everyone acted selfishly as he does, then the entire review system would collapse (or at least become useless), and everyone ends up with nothing.\n\nThus the hotel is the \"public good\" (though it isn't actually one).  I find this explanation is more reasonable then attempting to define the reviews as the shared good under consideration.","timestamp":"2011-09-30T06:47:18.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}
