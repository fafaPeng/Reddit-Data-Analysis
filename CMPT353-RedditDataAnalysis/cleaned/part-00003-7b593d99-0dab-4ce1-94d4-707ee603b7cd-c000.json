{"author":"glorifiedfactchecker","body":"Let me clear this up, you see a time zone is a region on Earth that has a uniform, legally mandated standard time.Almost all time zones on land have legally defined borders which coincide with the borders of the country mandating the time or some subdivision thereof. Of the 40 time zones on land, most are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTC−12 to UTC+14), but a few are offset by 30 or 45 minutes from a nearby hourly zone. In addition to land time zones, there are 25 nautical time zones, all separated by lines of longitude. Most (UTC−11 to UTC+11) are 15° of longitude wide, which is one hour of Earth's rotation relative to the Sun, but an hourly zone in the central Pacific Ocean is split into two 7.5° wide zones (UTC±12) by the 180th meridian, part of which coincides with the International Date Line. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west relative to the corresponding nautical time zones.

While the Mercator is a great map for navigation, it severely distorts land area near the poles, making Antarctica, Greenland, Europe, etc look much larger than they actually are. Thus, it is inappropriate to use it to depict any sort of large area data or phenomenon.\n\nComplaints against it are normally better directed at the map maker for using it inappropriately than at the projection itself. Criticism has taken on new life in the past few years because it's the projection Google and Bing use on their small scale web maps.

For (as I recall) a century or more before Einstein's GR, *lots* of physicists tried geometric interpretations of gravity.  They all failed because it turns out that if you curve space only (rather than spacetime) you never reproduce observed behaviour.  Even approximately, IIRC.\n\nThe fundamental idea in GR is that the objects aren't pulled at all.  They're just travelling straight lines through curved space.  Two people starting at the equator at different longitudes and travelling in straight lines that are initially going north will meet at the north pole.  They aren't pulled by anything -- it's the curvature of the Earth that brings them together.  Same idea for two masses sitting in space and travelling forward in time, so says GR.","timestamp":"2011-05-06T08:53:58.000-07:00","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":3,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"DarkColdFusion","body":"But some people have higher value on their time. Plus I see people go out of there way to save 10 cents a gallon and it never has made sense to me.\n\nMost cars I've seen have no greater then 14 gallons (SUV's and trucks are an exception but they get worse mileage). Most people in my experience fill up at **1/4th** a tank. Most cars probably are averaging *15* mph in a city, and most cars are getting under **20 mpg** in the city.\n\nSo to go one way I would expect that it would be **2.5** miles to go that extra 10 minutes. (More miles is worse)\n\n**2.5** of **20mpg** is **.125 gallons** used. My gas around here is about *4* bucks (Maybe it's cheaper for you) so at **3.90** it's costing me about **49 cents**.\n\nSo in filling up 10 minutes away probably saves me about **$1.05** which is suggested in the comic. I've spent probably **49 cents** to get there. If I have to drive back or some similar situation I've now doubled that. I've spent 10 minutes to save less then **10 cents**.\n\nNow you can do your own numbers, but honestly I'd rather waste 50 cents and not be on the road that much longer.","timestamp":"2011-09-13T22:39:17.000-07:00","score":10,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":10,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":2}

{"author":"hseldon10","body":"It is a tragedy of the commons is about the depletion of [public goods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) (or, if you prefer, a \"shared, limited resource\") through \"rational\" (which is the classical economist's way of saying \"selfish\") overuse or misuse of them.\n\nIf you think about it, hotels are not public goods; they are private property. The review sites are also not public goods. For a good to be \"public\" it needs to be non-rival and non-excludable. So, in a sense, the information collected by the review websites can be considered a public good. When the public good is processed by the private software algorithm of the review website company, it produces new information (which is also non-excludable in its access and it doesn't rival existing information). In that sense, the information provided by the website could also be considered a public good. (Just to answer this question in case somebody asks. If everything the website offers is a public good, then how does it make money? They make it through advertising. Advertising space is NOT a public good).\n\nIf the users of the website provide false or otherwise incorrect information for selfish gain, the public good will be \"depleted\" in the sense that it will lose its value. In this sense, it is a \"tragedy of the commons\" case. The fact that, by losing value, the website also loses the ability to profit through advertising sales is coincidental, and thus, does not invalidate this case as a \"tragedy of the commons\".\n\nSo, what is the solution? One solution is to privatize access to information (by charging a fee for use). Another solution would be to improve the algorithm, either by enriching the information gathering or by refining its process. In any case, regulation and/or privatization will solve the \"tragedy\" in this case, which also parallels the solutions for most instances of the tragedy of the commons elsewhere.","timestamp":"2011-09-29T23:16:40.000-07:00","score":11,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":11,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":4}

Is there really that much of a headache to migrate from Scala's actors to Akka's actors, such that re-writing an app in Clojure makes it worth it?  I understand the number of lines is much less (I'm thoroughly impressed here!), but I have to wonder if the re-training, etc, required to use Clojure was worth it.","timestamp":"2011-09-23T10:40:43.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"GMTao","body":"I suspect that rhetoric like this, while justified, is one of the reasons Play was selected for Typesafe's stack instead of David's Lift framework.  I love Lift, I think the design is great.  But I also help design APIs for a living, and I know how much of a pain binary compatibility can become.  Sun's model was originally sound, namely deprecate the code and remove it.  It's easier said than done however.\n\nMy suggestion for the Scala masters would be as follows:\n\n1. Stop breaking binary compatibility between every releases.  If you are going to break something, do it at a major release point, i.e. 3.0, 4.0, etc.\n\n2. Deprecate **only** when you have a replacement, and then keep the deprecated method for 2-3 minor releases, i.e. deprecate in 2.7.x but remove in 2.9.x.  Bug-fix releases (at least that's how I refer to them, namely the 3rd number in the version number) don't count.\n\n3. Try to do better than offering a tool that checks for binary compatibility.  It's a great start, but not perfect by a long shot.  Stability in the core libraries is what is needed, so David's point here is sound.\n\nAs for David's rant, he often goes to paint himself as one of the original people who started using Scala outside of Martin himself.  That's great, and I don't mean to belittle him at all.  I've used Scala for roughly a year now, so I don't claim to know nearly as much as he does.  David is likely right when he says things like he's written more Scala code than anyone else in the world.  Yet complaining publicly in a blog isn't going to help anything.  Maybe he has spoken with the Typesafe guys about this, I honestly don't know and I don't want to hazard guess.  However something about this plea just seems wrong; it seems more like whining and asking for others to back his opinion rather than trying to offer suggestions on how to fix the problem.  Typesafe seems to be hiring, perhaps he may want to consider working with them on the inside to instigate change.  But again given that Typesafe went with Play, I can't see that happening.\n\nAs an aside, I haven't worked with Play myself, but I can understand the reasoning behind Typesafe's decision to use it.  Namely if you want to get someone who's using RoR or Django for their web app (hell, even JSF) then Play is a natural stepping stone.  Lift needs some forethought and a whole lot of thinking things through in a different way.  Scala is enough of a challenge for those coming from these other languages and frameworks, combining that with Lift will likely lead to frustration and abandonment.","timestamp":"2011-12-07T20:46:35.000-08:00","score":10,"subreddit":"scala","ups":10,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}
