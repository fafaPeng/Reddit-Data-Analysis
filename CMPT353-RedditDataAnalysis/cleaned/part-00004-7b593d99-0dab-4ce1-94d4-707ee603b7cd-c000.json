{"author":"20EDFD","body":"I used Scala on a project for ~1.5 years, from 2009-2011. There are features of Scala that I really like, and other ones that are equally annoying. \n\n1. Implicit conversions/parameters are a powerful concept but incredibly prone to abuse. They make code hard to follow (where is this value coming from? Where is the method \"foo\" on class \"Bar\" defined? Oh it's not. WTF.). Maybe this will be less of an issue once debuggers and IDEs can show which implicits are in scope, but it is a headache trying to read through code with lots them in play.\n\n2. The fetish with facilitating DSL creation serves to bring out the worst in developers. SBT is prime example of this. Entities with names like =:= are simply absurd. What the hell is that anyway? Call me square but I prefer something \"foldLeft\" to \"/:\" or \"prepend\" to \"+:\" any day. Nor do I give a shit that Haskell/ML/Foobar did it that way first.\n\n3. The \"cake pattern\" sucks. Maybe I'm just dense, but I fail to see how it improves over simple delegation. And it scatters functionality all over lots of little classes.\n\n4. The compiler is just too slow. Nor does the \"use SBT\" response satisfy if you have decided (rationally) to not use it in your project.\n","timestamp":"2011-11-30T06:59:16.000-08:00","score":5,"subreddit":"scala","ups":5,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

I guess sometimes I'm narrow minded in why someone would be motivated to do certain things, so I need to expand my horizon to get a better idea of why engineers work for the military. Is it mostly a patriotic reason behind doing it? Do you feel you are protecting your country? I can see some motivation behind it, because I love my country, but I just don't trust the people that are given the power to destroy the world: Politicians, lawyers, and businessmen. Personally, I think the engineer can make sensible decisions and justify what he is making, and in the right hands, what he creates would do good; however, what control does the engineer have over what his creation is used for? If an engineer designs a bomb, does he control for whom the bomb drops? I know you can make the case that any creation you create could be used for evil, but one that creates a bomb knows what the bomb is used for. \n\nSorry for the rambling.

Because black hole formation is explosive, the object would lose a certain amount of its energy in the process, which, according to the mass–energy equivalence, means that a black hole would be of lower mass than the parent object, and actually have a weaker gravitational pull.^[44]\n\n\nSorry, Wikipedia, but I'm afraid you're incorrect.","timestamp":"2011-01-05T10:22:16.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

So I share new things as I discover them, and post scanned documents and photos to illustrate them.

I found out that my great-great grandfather had a sister in Australia who I had no idea existed - she was in another state, but published a notice when he died to inform local people in her state - he hadn't lived there for many years.  She didn't publish one in his state, so I would never have found it searching here on microfilm.  Try the websites of libraries and museums in the areas where your family members lived.","timestamp":"2011-02-13T04:56:19.000-08:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

In all cases the ownership costs of the diesel vehicle were significantly less than the gasoline vehicle, including initial purchase price premium and fuel premium, however for a variety of reasons I did not purchase one.

{"author":"sTiKyt","body":"&gt;If you locked people in a box for a year with 500 still frames of Joe Viden eating a sandwich, by the end they'd be adamant that some were great and some were terrible.\n\nAnd what's so wrong about that. Obviously using that example there's a natural desire to seek perfection in whatever level of detail you are presented. There's nothing wrong with that. If we didn't have that evolutionary trait we'd probably still be sleeping on dirt floors and eating crudely cooked berries mixed with other kinds of muck.\n\nThere's nothing shameful about seeking perfection, without it being obsessive. I know any time in my life I've been stunned by another culture's achievements whether culinary, technological or social; it's always been something any other culture could have achieved if not a for a \"that's good enough\" attitude. \n\nI think the problem is Randall's confusing perfectionism with pretentiousness when in fact both can be quite the opposite. Perfectionism is constantly striving towards living an ideal while it's simply obsessing over something minute simply because it's socially valued and gives you social status could easily get you labeled as pretentious.\n\nThere's nothing necessarily pretentious about being a connoisseur. Some people like wine, I do. Some people like it enough to enjoy the intricate differences between different carefully crafted brands, that's fine too. I don't like Scotch, I couldn't tell the difference between an expertly brewed, aged, masterpiece and a $5 bottle from liquor store bargin bin. That doesn't mean I don't think there's any value in crafting the perfect bottle of the stuff. I'd be more than happy to develop that kind of taste if I could stand it in the first place.","timestamp":"2011-06-22T03:25:49.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

{"author":"Klaperman","body":"&gt; And finally look at the return types AND the argument types of most scala functions. They are not of type `Option`. So that means authors of those functions MUST check their arguments for null. Are you sure that even half of them follow that rule ? Do you have ANY guarantees of the sort?\n\nI am absolutely sure that all of them follow the convention of not returning null, or tolerating null arguments.  Let me reiterate this rule:\n\n * If you are calling a function *written in Scala* which is not explicitly implementing a Java interface that mandates use of `null` (this case is very rare, and if it happens, you will be warned in documentation), `null` is neither returned nor permitted as an argument.  Period.  The only two exceptions are:  1) The `apply` method of object `scala.Option`, whose purpose is to take a perhaps-`null` argument (e.g., as returned from a Java method) and convert it to an `Option`; and 2) The `orNull` method of class `scala.Option`, whose purpose is to convert `Some(x)` to `x` and `None` to `null`.  If you are writing a Scala function that calls a Java method, you must consider the possibility of a null return from that method or the necessity to pass null to that method, *and you must shield these nullability considerations from the caller of the Scala function*.\n\nIf you do not follow this rule, you and your software will be shunned by the Scala community.  You will fail technical interviews for Scala jobs.  I don't mean to be harsh, but it's the truth.\n\n&gt; &gt; Linguistic enforcement is not necessary;\n\n&gt; I think i heard this argument before. Oh yeah, \"We do not need a garbage collector. Just follow the guidelines for creating and disposing memory pointers.\"\n\nI fail to see your point here.  The kind of \"linguistic enforcement\" we are discussing here is *static* (done at compile-time).  A garbage collector is a runtime consideration.  Very few, if any, languages provide static linguistic enforcement of proper pointer usage, since the requisite analysis is often prohibitive.  Those that do (I'm thinking of Rust) don't provide complete enforcement and constrain you to certain patterns of development (which is not necessarily a problem, but is distinct from sole \"enforcement\").  Also, the \"guidelines for creating and disposing memory pointers\" are *really complicated*.  And dynamically allocating memory isn't something you can just avoid.  *In contrast, in Scala, using `null` is something you can avoid most of the time, and there are very simple rules regarding proper `null` usage.*\n\nI hope this helps.  If you are still unconvinced, you can take a look at one of my Scala projects: [JGo](http://jgo.googlecode.com/).  Grep for `null`.  You'll see it in Java code, of course, and where I interact with ASM, a Java library for JVM bytecode generation, but little elsewhere.  Anywhere else null occurs (I can think of only one such place), it is to check for initialization errors and pinpoint where they occur for debugging purposes.  You'll also see some discussion of NPE's as indications of bad initialization in the comments.\n","timestamp":"2011-08-19T14:07:45.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"gfixler","body":"Speaking of perception...\n\nAll through high school, early 90s, I thought a ton about depth perception. I'd had always loved 3D books and posters. I still have my glasses from [3D World Runner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSvcbn9HFHQ) for the NES, and I've used them any time I've run across a red/blue 3D thing for 24 years now (*Jesus!* It's been that long?).\n\nI went to Disney World with my folks around 1990 and picked up a poster from a souvenir shop there - the first 'random dot stereogram' I'd ever seen, or heard of (shortly before that fad exploded in malls everywhere). It was a rainbow gradient from top to bottom and there were 3D dinosaurs in it.\n\nI bought a book on how to program stereograms in 1992, just because I wanted to know the method of generating them. There was no internet yet on which to look this stuff up. At home I skipped to that section, red the theory, then threw the book aside (never looked in it again) and wrote my own version in Qbasic that day. It was glorious. I went to my friend's place - another guy who toyed in Qbasic all the time - and showed him my work (had to spend 30 minutes teaching him to see them first), then unveiled my big plan. We were going to animate them. He was afraid for our brains, but after about an hour of fiddling, taking breaks to watch TV and jam on his parent's living room piano, we had it working perfectly. We were going to be rich. Alas, we did nothing with it, but still managed to get angry about a tape we found in Sam Goody 2 years later with \"The World's First Animated Stereograms!\" Of course, it wasn't a successful tape, but still...\n\nThen sometime around 1993-1994, thinking again about how the brain interprets left and right eye signals to provide a 3D image, I wondered what it would be like to reverse my eyeballs. Thinking about it now, I could have just hacked some 3D ViewMaster type thing to test it out with premade stills, but I wanted it live. I ran through ideas like finding old camcorders and taking out the tiny video eyepieces and making some monstrosity I could wear around, but then I decided to figure it out with mirrors. I pretty quickly drew up a design, and then asked for permission to destroy an old mirror. I picked up a [glass cutter](http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Tungsten-Carbide-Wheel-Cutter/dp/B004B7FPLM/ref=sr_1_2?s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314007933&amp;sr=1-2) from the hardware store, cut out squares, built a little box with adjustable angles inside and put together a prototype.\n\nIt actually worked, but I ran into the big limitation - my brain. Brains work really hard to understand what they're seeing, which is one reason we see so many things that aren't there when we aren't sure what we're seeing. Our brains don't like to not know, so they start inventing for us. This greatly diminished my hoped-for effect, which was that everything far would look near and vice-versa, with even convex shapes appearing concave, etc. The best results were looking through things like open doors and windows, whereupon the stuff on the other side would look kind of like a textured block poking through the open space toward me, and my stepdad sitting on the couch with a floor lamp behind him, which looked like it was coming out of the center of his head.\n\nI found out decades later online that the idea was much older than me, and there was even a name for it. They're called [pseudoscopes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscope). Looking up the term again just now, I found [this guy](http://vimeo.com/14870320) who wrote \"UPD: As it turns out I re-invented the wheel. There is the same device known as Pseudoscope en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/ Pseudoscope. But anyway I had fun doing it.\" Stupid inventions, always turning out to have been invented before (story of my life). Everyone else's version of this is simpler than mine, although the simplest, [from the wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pseudoscope_mirror_stratton.PNG) occurred to me and was quickly thrown out, because I was worried about one eye having to 'see farther' than the other one.\n\nSeen from above, mine looked like this:\n\n     __________\n    |   | /   /|\n    |   |/   / |\n    |\\       \\ |\n    | \\       \\|\n    | /   /|   |\n    |/___/_|___|\n\nImagine the / and \\ characters are 45° angles. There were 4 wooden blocks. The large ones on the left and right walls had 2 mirrors, and the 2 small ones at the front and back had them only on the diagonal faces. The whole thing was about 4\" square, made of 1/4\" plywood top and bottom plates and pine blocks with 1\" square mirrors. I also drilled peg holes through the top plate and into the top of each block and glued pegs into the blocks so I could adjust them to get them perfectly aligned. It was like a little pair of binoculars.","timestamp":"2011-08-22T03:31:44.000-07:00","score":103,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":103,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":1}

So when you are looking at entering class profiles the numbers from the class of 2014 will be the only one that is relevant.  Also, it's near impossible to find a practice test on the internet without having to buy a prep book, but when you register to take the test they do give you a practice one to use which is about a fouth as long as the real one.\n\n3.

{"author":"runT1ME","body":"This guy's premise is totally backwards.  He goes on to say how in large projects, there are practically DSLs, components that not everyone knows, etc.  Basically that the learning curve of jumping into a large project is extremely high.\n\nSo to me that seems like a great reason to use Scala.  If no one is expecting a new programmer to the project to hit the ground running, what does it matter if he's less than an expert in the language and has to experiment a bit.  Granted, Scala can be taken to the extreme where all but an expert can easily understand it, but assuming most of the code is &lt;= Ordeksy's level 2 stuff, any smart Java programmer should be able to figure it out.\n\nIf you know that your project is large enough that no single team member is going to understand all of it, why not get a productivity boost to those that are willing to try out Scala?
