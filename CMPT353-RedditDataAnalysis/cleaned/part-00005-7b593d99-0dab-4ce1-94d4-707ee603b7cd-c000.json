{"author":"WannabeOD","body":"In August I am going to be starting my second year at ICO in Chicago. I picked it partly because I was somewhat familiar with the city having grown up about an hour and a half away from it, but mostly because their academics are really good with board pass rates in the high 90s every year, and mainly that the focus of the school is to make you the best clinician you can be where you get to start interacting with patients your second quarter. The facilities are new and top of the line since they had remodled the clinic a few years ago, all new practice lanes for us last year and as they speak they are remodeling the lecture center. Also with 20% of practicing ODs being alumni they have a large network to help with job placement/practice purchasing once I graduate.  Sorry that was so long, I really like it there and had a lot to say. If you have any other questions about anything let me know since I may be able to give a little bit fresher perspective being that I am in the middle of school instead of being a few years out, not saying that the ODs won't be helpful either.","timestamp":"2011-06-21T09:29:55.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"optometry","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":2}

{"author":"gereedy","body":"The objective is to build an implementation of Scala for another runtime environment; one that gets compiled to native code (like C++, D and Go that you mentioned). My goal is not necessarily to run existing Scala source code. I don't want to reproduce the Java APIs that would be required for that. Besides possible legal issues, it's just too much and isn't the best job. I might consider building a source code translation tool at some point like is being done with the .Net backend. I would like to see Scala grow a standard library that can be used to write programs portable between backends.\n\nFor garbage collection I will probably write a simplistic mark-sweep collector in C at first. If I adopt the collectors in MMTK it would probably be by building the capability to write the collector in scala and porting the source of MMTK to scala.\n\nI will also try to implement a foreign function interface pretty soon to eliminate the awkward dance between scala and C that I have right now.\n\nThe website for the project is http://greedy.github.com/scala/ which has some more information like links to a google group for the project and information on contributing. If you, or anyone else, has the time and interest it'd be great if you would contribute. Even something like providing a scala program you'd like to be able to run natively using LLVM would be helpful.\n\nOne of my goals is for Scala+LLVM to be a platform for experimenting with language implementation approaches, so it would really make a lot of sense for it to be a testbed for future language features. Though any such feature would have to have a way to implement it on the JVM as well. Tail call optimization should be easy to implement since LLVM has built-in support for it. The only reason it's not done now is because of the way exceptions are being handled.","timestamp":"2011-06-05T22:00:43.000-07:00","score":3,"subreddit":"scala","ups":3,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

In that case, you will have to ask permission to view them, or make a written request for their archivist to search for you.  This is not ideal, as you don't know the dates of marriages.  And could be slow.  But it is better than nothing.  \n\n2.  The records may have been archived at the regional archdiocese.  Mine had a website with an online form for genealogy requests.  I will say that in the last couple years, the Catholic church has become increasingly protective of their records.  Thats not to say they will not help you, it just may take some time, and you may run into an abrasive archivist or two.  \n\nIn regards to Catholics being stingy with their records, I was told by a nun archivist in my neck of the woods that the Catholic church got annoyed with the Mormons because the Mormons convert people posthumously.  The Catholics did not like their records available to everyone, just to have their followers converted after death.  Take that anecdote for what you will.

If you don't already have all of this infrastructure available to you, then monads seem like they would be more trouble than they are worth.\n\nSo it really isn't at all surprising to me that people in ML and Scala are not that impressed with the IO monad;  there simply isn't the same level of infrastructure built up around monads to make using them pleasant, so why bother going to the extra trouble?","timestamp":"2011-12-08T06:10:37.000-08:00","score":6,"subreddit":"scala","ups":6,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":4}

It depicts light going through a [prism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_%28optics%29), [dispersing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_prism) the separate wavelengths.\n2. The owner of the dorm room poster also keeps his side of the room messy, dispersing what should otherwise have been neat and tidy over the room.\n3. Note that the dispersion of the light beam in the Pink Floyd poster is pointing at right-hand-side room mate's side of the room.  It is implied that the messy room mate is spreading his mess over into the side neatly room mate.  \n4.

The first, my family is terribly uncreative when it comes to names. Everyone is John, Daniel, Henry, Jacob, or Francis. At one point I have 3 Daniel/Sarah Summit couples living in the same county. The second problem is that I feel the Summitt research line is oversaturated by 1 or 2 researchers who have been ... less than judicious with assigning relationships. They've flooded the internet with some what sloppily sourced work. They lumped Daniel and Henry in with John Summit because that seems to be one of the few choices, it helped fill a hole in their patriarchal Summitt founding line.\n\nThe third, lesser, problem is that there seems to be an exodus of Summitts from that founding line circa 1820-1830. The 1840 census is almost devoid of Summits then 1850 it's a party all over again. Daniel and Henry both moved close to their wives families so I have no clue where they live prior.

Because I'd bookmarked it, I could totally stop thinking about it - I wouldn't forget it. Every now and then I'd remember the folder and go look through it. Invariably, half or more of the list would be things I didn't want anymore, and I'd remove them. Sometimes I'd even think \"WTF? Why did I ever want this?\" It would be some really weird or pointless thing that held no interest for me anymore. It's amazing how much money I saved. It has to have been in the thousands of dollars.\n\nToo, it has since increased the maturity level of my buying, so now I don't even need to bookmark most things, because I can tell I'm not going to care in a few months, and it's not worth blowing the money on something that only pays back in happiness for such a short time. It's helped me save up for things I care about for far longer, like expensive tools for my woodshop that will last me a decade or more, and are always a joy to use.","timestamp":"2011-04-20T03:26:47.000-07:00","score":8,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":8,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

{"author":"flabbergasted1","body":"&gt; You say that the rod representing the large central mass extends infinitely to the left and right along the time axis, which suggests it's always been there, and always will be there. So why do we see a change in the universe's thickness \"as we go forward over our time axis\" (ala the \"horn\"). What is causing variance over time?\n\nIf the mass rod has always existed, our universe will be consistently horn-shaped.  If you prefer, you can imagine that the universe was cylindrical up until the day a mass decided to appear in the center, at which point the universe began to tighten inwards.\n\n&gt; Also, in the first place, why is the mass at the center of the universe shrinking the rest of the universe? It is an \"odd effect\" as you say, but is there some reason to expect this? I can't come up with an intuitive way to imagine it. Contrast this with the rubber sheet example, the whole point of which is to provide an intuitive (if incomplete) way of thinking about space as a \"malleable\" 3-D thing, just like rubber is a malleable 2-D thing.\n\nI can't really answer this.  What I was trying to explain with this comment is how the rule \"massive objects curve space-time\" produces the effects of gravitation without using gravity again, but I have no idea how or why it is that objects with mass have this effect on space-time.   Maybe somebody over at [r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience) will have an answer.\n\n&gt; \"...the lives and journeys of any point creatures which live in this universe will be represented by infinitely long threads...\" Presumably you mean \"finite threads\"? They start when their life begins and stop when their life ends, right?\n\nSure, if you want.  I was choosing to imagine that this particular universe was the home to some wandering point creatures that have always existed and always continue to (as I assumed with the mass, as explained above) because I find that easier to justify than points/masses suddenly popping into or out of existence.  The concept works exactly way if you'd like the points and masses to be mortal.","timestamp":"2011-05-07T05:13:59.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":6}

Minnie and Caroline (who moved back to italy). After 1890, Thomas and Rose divorce.  Thomas remarries, has more kids.  Rose disappears.  Later in my research, I come across an old researchers notes about this part of my family.  All it says about Rose is that she died at 74 years old in California.  I don't know what year she was born, so I don't know approximately what year she died.  Thomas was born in 1865, so that gives a rough estimate I suppose.  I don't know if Rose remarried or anything.  And the researcher who made the notation about 74 years old in California has been dead since 1990.  \n\nSo, Rose Crosetti died at 74 years old in California.  I would love to find a death record that may lead me to a birth town.  Any help would be much appreciated.","timestamp":"2011-04-17T13:52:23.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

You never know, someone may have put the real father's name on your father's birth record or baptismal record.  These suggestions assume you haven't already gone that route.

You originally argued that sometimes the market will not do things that are \"good for humanity.\" Now that we have established that is subjective, it seems your argument boils down to \"Sometimes the market will not naturally do things that I want to see happen.\"\n\nHumans agree in the marketplace constantly, which is what enables big picture things to seemingly magically appear in our stores. If you are interested in exploring this a bit deeper, there is a good book called \"I, Pencil\" which illustrates how spontaneous order coordinates millions of humans to come together and produce something as simple as a pencil.\n\n\n&gt;My only point is that the Market does not always infallibly pick the best option at the right time and then implement it efficiently.\n\nI agree. Mistakes are made all the time; the participants are only human. But it is the best \"system\" we have.

Think giant ACME magnet like the coyote used to try and catch the road runner. Chuck it near the side of that happy pulsing stream of electrons, and watch it happily move like lemmings towards cliffs in made up Disney documentaries. Woohoo! You moved your dot to the left!\n\nOkay, now put the magnet on the other side. Yay! It's on the right! It's awesome!\n\nOkay, now become Superman. Or Superwoman.

Now get an ordinary human with ordinary human eyes (preferrably leaving them inside the human) and get them to describe what they can see.  Astounded by your technical awesomeness, along with your spandex, they will see a line!
