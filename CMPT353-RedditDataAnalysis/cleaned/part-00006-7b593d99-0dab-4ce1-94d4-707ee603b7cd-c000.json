{"author":"StandsTooClose","body":"I was born and lived in Pontiac, Michigan growing up (I am now 48). At 9, our family moved to Commerce Township, about 15 miles away. We were very close to my paternal grandmother and her family, but we were very distant from my paternal grandfather's family, who had died when my dad was 16 (and before that, had divorced my grandmother a couple of years after my dad was born). \n\nMy dad was an only child. I heard all kinds of stories about why the split happened (religion, drunkenness, a controlling great grandmother, etc) but never paid any attention.\n\nHere's where it gets a little interesting.\nWhen we moved to Commerce, we'd be driving around and I'd see my last name on road signs - Decker Road. I asked my dad and he had no idea if we were related to those Deckers or not. At the same time, he'd point out farms that he'd spent time on as a boy - cousins on his mother's side. \n\nWhen I was 9 my mom passed away, and we spent a lot of time at her mom's house, because my dad wanted us to stay close to her relatives. Well, in talking to my grandma, she'd occasionally drop that her ancestors on her mom's side of the family and my ancestors on my dad's side of the family all knew each other and lived in the same area... Commerce Township. \n\nSo, I'm a history buff and I started researching it all. Turns out my relatives all \"hung around\" each other throughout the mid-late 1800's and into the early 20th century - played in town bands, went to church together, witnessed marriages. One g-g-g grandfather threshed all the farms in the area, so he knew everybody.  Anyway they all scattered to the cities (mostly Pontiac) when the auto companies started up. I've done some mapping of the farms and homes where people lived then, and you can see that they all knew each other well but never married into each other's families until my mom married my dad.\n\nOf course, as I did my research I found things my dad never told us: My great grandmother, on her deathbed, announced that she wasn't really a *Doherty*, her last name was *Mulderick*. That our next door neighbor as I grew up in Pontiac was really a second cousin. That my 8th-great grandfather is Rev. Richard Mather, who fathered Increase Mather (who then fathered Cotton Mather, participant in the Salem witch trials).\n\nAnd of course that some of the kids I'd rode the bus to school with, were cousins. \n\nIt's been very interesting and very rewarding to put all of this together. Anytime I go to a historical society meeting, people roll their eyes and then get fired up because they know that some story or another is going to make one more connection. \n\nAs the stories have come out, I've become the \"historian\" and family members are sending me the old pictures and postcards they don't know what to do with, so I've got quite a collection of original documents as sources. \n\nAnd I'm very lucky to still live in the same area as my ancestors - it sure makes it simple to go to the libraries and see the houses and places where quite a few of my grandparents grew up.","timestamp":"2011-01-21T17:01:25.000-08:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"snpdragon","body":"When my first child was born in 1986, my aunty (my mother's sister) gave me a genealogy book and start up kit of forms and such as a gift - instead of the usual baby items. I've always been interested in my family history - I used to bother my grandmother with questions about her side of the family and my grandfather's side.  I now have some letters my dad received from his grandmother and great grandmother, and he was asking the same sorts of questions.\nI was hooked, and quite obsessed for about 7 years, but then I had 3 children, was working, studying... life took over, so I put it away for a while.  Back then there was no internet, either - it was all trips to the State Library and searching through microfilm microfiche and old documents and newspapers etc.  I dug it all out again recently and have started transferring all my old paper based records into a web-based tree and a blog that I started late last year.  For me genealogy is about history - people, places and stories, not just about dates and seeing how far back you can get.  So I write blog posts about a family or an event and illustrate it with old photos and other records.  There was a time in the mid-nineties when I had another go at it, and loaded alot of stuff onto a computer-based program (stored on 5.25\" floppies).  Some of the new things I learned that weren't stored on my card index system were lost - technology moved on, and my old computers and the floppies etc are all gone. The period I put it away for was just too long.  I would caution anyone to consider backing their research up in a variety of formats.  One day when I'm not here any more, someone will want all my research, and if they don't realise what it is, or can't access it, it will all be lost.  My blog is a way of sharing the information in a format that family members can access easily from where ever they are - its a great way of humanising the data and sharing it in a way that my family members - whether I know them or not - can access from anywhere.","timestamp":"2011-02-13T05:37:25.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

The 1940 census is going to be hosted on the national archives website and will be free to view but will not be indexed (searchable), from what I've heard.  \n\nThose two sites that you mentioned are the best free sites out there as far as I know.  So other than that, you can check with your local library or genealogical society, some offer free access to sites like ancestry.com. Another option is the state archives of whichever state you live in, if it is convenient to you.  Generally speaking they provide free access to ancestry, fold3/footnote, genealogybank, and other subscription sites.  In my experience most (each one is different though) will let you bring a flash drive and save stuff to it for free.  Others only let your print out documents for a fee per page.   The state archives or a genealogical society would also be a good place to find some help for advancing your research.  \n\nAs far as software... I don't really have one.  Most of them you have to manually input the info into it, although some will sync with ancestry I think but then that requires an account.  You may think this is a non-answer, but I'd suggest a plain old 3 ring binder, pencil and paper, and to save digital copies of documents on a flash drive.  It's far less likely that you will encounter problems that will cause you to lose all your research, it's much more portable if you need to take your research to a courthouse/archives/library/family reunion, and it's much easier to see gaps in your research that way too.  Also much cheaper than spending money on software.  \n\nGood luck...","timestamp":"2011-12-14T21:48:13.000-08:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

Tuples aren't a perfect example of this since the syntatic sugar that keeps you from having to use those ugly TupleN types is clearly a language level construct.  \n\nHowever, the existence of the TupleN types and the corresponding arbitrary size limit are visible and ugly to you only because they're implemented in the Scala standard libraries whereas that type of feature would be implemented purely behind the curtain in other languages.\n\nI agree with what you're saying (they're ugly) though I think it has no actual impact on the quality of Scala itself.\n\nThis reply isn't really meant to contend with what you're saying, just expressing some of my thoughts/understanding on the matter.","timestamp":"2011-02-26T08:41:25.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":6}

{"author":"gfixler","body":"It's honestly phenomenally strange to have gone from a child of the late 70s/early 80s to today. I had all of these preconceived notions. I thought/hoped/dreamed we have communication devices one day, but I imagined it all wrong. I didn't think we'd have 18,000 different phones, and 6-month or less turnover times between new versions. I didn't understand 'markets.' I thought we'd all have \"the phone,\" like everyone on Star Trek had \"the communicator.\" I didn't know *everyone* would want to keep in constant touch with each other. I didn't realize that lurked in the hearts of the populace, especially in kids. I hated talking on the phone as a kid, as did many of my friends. It was what girls did, not guys. We didn't want to say things to each other. We wanted to play sports or video games, or sport-based video games. Calling was just to arrange times to do these things. I didn't understand that there could be a time - besides a roadside emergency - that you'd really ever want to call anyone while out and about, because my entire life had conditioned me to simply call ahead, make a quick plan, then stick to it.\n\nThen after college, still resisting the cell phones my friends had mostly all had for a few years, I found myself entering a theme park with said friends only to have them all head in different directions immediately. I yelled \"Wait! Wait a minute.\" They all stopped, confused. \"What's the plan? Where are we meeting later? Who's going where?\" All the answers ranged from shrugs to \"I don't know. We'll figure that out later.\" I still didn't know what was going on, then it dawned on me. They'd just call each other later to meet up.\n\nIt was the most bizarre experience, like my friends had all been replaced by something different. I hadn't even realized the world had changed, and the complete lack of discussion when we got there as everyone seemingly instinctively fanned out from the gates in different directions told me that it had changed a while ago. My life flashed before my eyes a bit, thinking about my own methods for staying in touch with friends and communicating with them.\n\nIt started to occur to me that I didn't understand the world now, and it was only going to get worse. Facebook, which I also waited years to sign up for, asked me all the time for captcha confirmation, stating that I could turn that off if I just gave it my cell number. I didn't have one. Little by little the world was indeed changing, with extra content on popular culture being offered exclusively on phones.\n\nI was an extremely 'interested' kid, but in the early 80s, there was almost no way to look things up. I had to go to the library, but it was across town. How often are you going to cross town to look up a bird you saw in your yard, or to get more information on a particular figure from history you saw on a TV documentary? My aged dictionary didn't even have a lot of the words I would look up, and forget anything really new, which I wouldn't even have heard, lacking the internet to make me aware of it.\n\nIt almost saddens me, despite that I am glad I had all that time in childhood to explore the woods, build things, play with my dogs, wrestle and race friends, and go swimming. There's so much I could have learned so much earlier. I like making things - all sorts of things, from Halloween costumes on my sewing machine and electronics stuff at my bench, to machined parts and woodworked items, but I didn't even know there was such a thing as a mini mill until Make Magazine came along - which I found out about online - and eventually held the first Maker Faire, which I attended in San Mateo, where I finally saw a mini mill. I've always wanted a mill, but they're huge, crazy heavy, and 10s of 1000s of dollars. I didn't know there were small, ~$1k versions for the 15 years I could have safely and intelligently operated one. I had so many little invention ideas I would have made.\n\nI feel as though I'm playing catch-up all the time now, reading voraciously every night through the online materials of my many hobbies. I finally got a cellphone, and it's been very nice, honestly. It's much more than just the portable phone I never wanted. It's connected me much more with people in ways I do like. I can snag a picture of something I'm working on in my woodshop and post it to Facebook immediately, and show projects as I make them. This has lead to probably 30 requests from friends to buy items in the last month or two. Another friend used Facebook exclusively, and mostly via our phones to commission me and keep in touch with me as I built a cyc wall for his photo studio this past week.

Tuesday and Wednesday are midweek, stuff happens at work that is more likely to get talked about. Thursday is most likely higher then Wednesday due to how close it is to party time/weekend/get laid time so there is a higher chance of preexisting plans the period ruined.

There's no way around it, no guarantee that the author of function made sure the null will not pass through.\n\nSecond, you are not going to use ONLY standard Scala library. That will make scala itself pretty useless. The power of any language is in the ecosystem of thrid-party libraries available to its users.\n\nAnd that's another huge field that is completely out of your control.\n\nAnd finally look at the return types AND the argument types of most scala functions. They are not of type Option. So that means authors of those functions MUST check their arguments for null. Are you sure that even half of them follow that rule ? Do you have ANY guarantees of the sort ?\n\nBtw i tried a small tutorial in scala code and it was very easy to introduce a null pointer exception. \n\n&gt;Linguistic enforcement is not necessary; \n\nI think i heard this argument before.

They typicall have full name, birth/death dates, and other family buried near by. I've been lucky my family is very local. They moved here in the early colonial period and never left.

{"author":"thesolitaire","body":"Just so you know, none of the trees on Ancestry have his parents.  There are quite a few results, but most have pretty much the same information as you.  There does appear to be a portrait and a headstone picture (taken in Grove City, Ohio. Other trees say that he is buried at Old Concord Cemetery), but they are marked as private, so I can't get them for you.  There is some disagreement about when he moved to Ohio.  There are two census records for a John Martino for 1820 and 1830:\n\n1820 United States Federal Census for Darby, Pickaway, Ohio\n\n1820 United States Federal Census for Nanticoke, Sussex, Delaware\n\n1820 United States Federal Census for Darby, Pickaway, Ohio\n\n1830 United States Federal Census for Nanticoke, Sussex, Delaware\n\nso it is a bit unclear on where he lived at that time. It is probable that there are two different John Martinos, but the censuses at that time have very little information; just head of family name and a count of other members of the household, so it is hard to figure out which one is yours. If you would like the counts, message me and I'll post them.\n\n1840, 1850, and 1860 have US Census records in Jackson, Franklin,  Ohio\n\nI looked at Ohio state censuses, but there is nothing that I can see that is any use.\n\nAside from what you mentioned, it appears that he served in the war of 1812. \n\n&gt;War of 1812 Service Records about John Martino\n\n&gt;Name: John Martino\n\n&gt;Company: RENICK'S MTD. REG'T, OHIO VOLS. AND MIL.\n\n&gt;Rank - Induction: PRIVATE\n\n&gt;Rank - Discharge: PRIVATE\n\n&gt;Roll Box: 133\n\n&gt;Roll Exct: 602\n\nI don't know anything about those records, but it is possible that there is more information on the full record, if you can get hold of a copy (there isn't a scanned original document on ancestry).\n\n  Sometimes I find shifting the search to a sibling can help, so I did a quick search to see if I could find any possible siblings, and there were a few possible matches. The first is a possible sister that also moved to Ohio.\n\n&gt;1850 United States Federal Census about Elizabeth Martino\n&gt;Name: Elizabeth Martino\n\n&gt;Age: 73\n\n&gt;Estimated Birth Year: abt 1777\n\n&gt;Birth Place: Delaware\n\n&gt;Gender: Female\n\n&gt;Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Madison, Fayette, Ohio\n\n&gt;Family Number: 87\n\n&gt;Household Members: \t\n\n&gt;*Elizabeth Martino, age 73\n\n&gt;*Oakley Wright, age 68\n\nReally, the only thing I'm going on here is that she was born around the same time in Delaware, and then emigrated to Ohio, just like your John Martino. Its not clear whether Martino is her maiden or married name, but it might be worth a shot.  Unfortunately, there are no trees or other records (that I can find) on ancestry.com.\n\nThe rest are all census records of Martinos in Sussex County, Delaware around the same time:\n\nWm Martino, census in 1810, Bridgeville, Sussex, Delaware.   Between 26-44 y/o, (probably) living with wife and two sons ages between 10-16. So likely born around 1780, making him a possible brother. (sadly no birth location)\n\nReuben Martin (possibly Martino/Martins/Marlin) 1810 in Little Creek Hundred, Sussex, Delaware. Between 26-44 y/o, (probably) living with wife and children: 1 son &lt;10 y/o, 1 son 10-16 y/o, 1 daughter 10-15 y/o, 1 daughter 16-25 y/o.  Makes him likely to have been born some time around 1770-1775 (very rough estimate). No birth location\n\nManain Martino (Manain Martins/Manam Martino/Manaen Martino) 1840 in  Little Creek Hundred, Sussex, Delaware. Living alone, age between 40-49, making him born between 1790-1800.\n\nSilas Martino (Silas Martins, Silas Martins) 1830 in Broad Creek, Sussex, Delaware. Age 30-39 y/o, living with wife (30-39 y/o), 3 sons, one aged 5-9 and two under 5 y/o. 3 daughters, 1 under 5 y/o, and 2 10-14 y/o.  I would estimate his birth around 1795.\n\nLorensa D Martino (Louisa D Martins) 1830 in Broadkill, Sussex, Delaware. The name is unclear, but it appears that the head of the household is a male, age 20-29.  There are also two females living there, ages &lt;5 y/o and 15-19 y/o.  I'm guessing a young family, with one daughter.  The male would have been born between 1801-1810, making him less likely to be a brother to John Martino, but still possible.\n\nNancy Martino (Wanry Martins)  1840 in Dagsboro Hundred, Sussex, Delaware. Woman 30-39 y/o living with a young boy, age 5-9 y/o.  It is possible that she is a widow, but I noticed that higher up on the page, there is an annotation on another record \"wid\" (just a note next to the name, not an official census column), so it is possible that widowhood was being recorded by this census taker.  \n\nFinally - there is a Martino family around the same time on Staten Island, NY, including a John Martino born around the same time.  I don't see any reason, though, to assume that there is a relationship. Just wanted to help you avoid confusion.\n\nHope that some of this information is useful, or at least new to you!","timestamp":"2011-11-08T04:26:44.000-08:00","score":4,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":4,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":2}

Type annotations allow type errors to be reported sooner and closer to the actual source of error in simple HM-style systems. I could easily give numerous examples of this. This is especially true in languages like Standard ML or Haskell where polymorphic signatures actually enforce polymorphism. (OCaml's type system, unfortunately, is not well-designed and fails to handle this.)\n\nType annotations in SML are of marginal benefit and, I think, that benefit is outweighed by the degradation in readability. Obviously that is not true in Haskell but I see that as a design flaw.\n\n&gt; That said, you'd be better off arguing against the fundamental design decisions you disagree with rather than the necessary outcome of those decisions. In other words, Scala's approach to inference is, in my opinion, the right choice given the rest of the system.

Of course, that's not as easy.\n\nI was trying to argue against the fundamental design decisions that have cost Scala type inference.
