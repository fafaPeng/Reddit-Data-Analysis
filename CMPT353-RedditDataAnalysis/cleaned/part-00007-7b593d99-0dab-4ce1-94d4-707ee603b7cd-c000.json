{"author":"RickyP","body":"Training.  I've never ascended from depth without a depth gauge and I've never come straight up from 60m, but its slow and it feels very slow.  At that depth you have alot of air in your lungs (7x their volume at the surface), so you can go a while with one breath.  An ascent from depth with a single breath at pressure is an odd feeling, I've done it from 20m, and it is amazing how much air you have in your lungs, you can breath out the expanding air for what seems like several minutes.  \n\nThe rule of thumb is not to ascend faster than your bubbles, but that's usually far too fast.  If your airway is open and you're breathing out, the air will exit at a natural rate as the gas expands in your lungs.  As long as it's a once up, and your lungs don't over-expand, you're likely to be OK since it takes a few minutes for your blood to circulate through your body body and reach equilibrium with N2 concentration.  If nothing else, you're probably worse off staying in a sunken submarine at that depth.","timestamp":"2011-07-01T09:55:14.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"scubaguy","body":"A good interview from a couple of experts on Scala. There are some good bits to take away:\n\n* David argues the logic \"Scala is a superior computer language to Java and programs written in Scala are superior ... than those written in Java\" is flawed if you are considering using Scala in a large organization. His focus has been on the point \"the cost of institutional change to Scala is very high\". He asserts ignoring the cost and focusing on the benefit is a logical flaw.\n\n* To be concise, the biggest hurdle a Java developer has to overcome learning Scala is not falling back on their Java mutable ways. But there are plenty of other hurdles (the type system, the documentation, lack of well defined patterns, etc.)\n* [Scala developers] won't be cheap (average cost $250/hr plus whatever markup I add.) They won't be local. But they will be excellent.\n\n* I think Scala is technically superior to Java, but it's not superior enough to overcome the predictability of using a known solution\n\n* If it makes you feel better to think, \"I like Scala so I must be in the top 5% of developer\" knock yourself out, but I would advise against believing your own press on that one. I have a bigger problem with people deciding that others are not smart enough to learn a particular language.\n\n\n* I think that there are people in the Scala community that do groove on intellectual bullying. But that's a significant minority, although they are pretty vocal.\n* A shoutout to GridGain.\n\n* one great way to try out Scala with a minimum of risk is to use it to write your tests for an existing Java project. Testing code doesn't go out to production, and libraries like ScalaTest, ScalaCheck and Borachio can greatly increase your productivity when writing tests.\n\n* Groovy is the worst of all possible worlds. It exists because JRuby wasn't quite up to snuff when Groovy was born. But Groovy is ugly (like Java), has inconsistent syntax, has weak meta-programming, weak performance, junk for a type system, etc. ... I think that Groovy is in the space of, \"Well... there's nothing better. It's not something to get excited about, but it's better than nothing.\" Kind of like plastic garbage cans. They dent less than metal ones and have very little else to get excited about.\n\n* learning Scala will familiarize you with the features you will probably see in other modern statically typed languages that will be released in the next few years, so what have you got to lose?\n\n* Will Scala be the next Java? Unlikely, but it seems like it has a shot at being a tier one language like Ruby or Python. It just may take fifteen years. Scala, with its strongly typed, modern programming language features, and few legacy warts, is perhaps inspiring a bumper crop of new competitors (eg Ceylon, and Kotlin) and some retooling of olds ones (Groovy++ and Gosu) \n","timestamp":"2011-10-05T06:45:43.000-07:00","score":7,"subreddit":"scala","ups":7,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

Add to that the tendency to \"Latinize\" names beyond recognition, or the reverse, and the chances are pretty slim that family names will survive that long, at least in the Western Empire.

There's a tradeoff between the loss of runtime type info (JVM erasure) and code bloat (C++ templates).  However, my point was that both Scala and Kotlin deal with the JVM type erasure in a similar way; it's just more explicit and therefore a bit more onerous the way Scala currently handles it.

{"author":"hseldon10","body":"No, no.\n\nInformation, such a recommendation on a website produced through the processing of a multitude of reviews, is a public good.\n\nIf the information's value depends on the quality of the reviews that the process is fed, then feeding it non-valuable reviews (such as incorrect or false reviews) will deplete the value of the \"recommendation\" generated by the process. In this sense, if everyone behaved as selfishly as hat-guy and fed the website false reviews for their own personal gain, they will eventually deplete the \"recommendation\" information.\n\nBy my link, it says that true \"non-rivalry\" and \"non-excludability\" does not exist. So, economists accept this definition applied to goods that can't satisfy the requirements 100% but are so abundant that they approximate the definition. They give the example of \"air\". If you breathe the air, that's technically one less breath for any other person trying to breathe, but since there's so much of it, it can be considered a \"non-rival\" good. And yet, pollution can (and does) deplete the atmosphere of breathable air.\n\nDepletion, thus, doesn't necessarily mean that you consume so much of the resource that it ceases to exist. It can also mean that you mis-use or pollute the resource so much that its value ceases to exist. An example would be farmland. If you pollute the farmland, the farmland doesn't cease to exist, but it is no longer possible to safely produce healthy food in that farmland, and thus it's value has been depleted.\n\nI am talking about depletion in this sense. You deplete the value of the recommendation by polluting through misuse (feeding the website incorrect or false information for selfish gain).\n\nThis is the very definition of the tragedy of the commons.","timestamp":"2011-09-30T08:31:47.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"gereedy","body":"I pretty much agree with you on all these points. I think most programmers think one character = one glyph on the screen. Making characters 32-bit doesn't solve this but at least you can't corrupt a string any more by breaking a pair or something like that.\n\nOn the other hand I think that String as a sequence of code points is correct because at some times and for some applications this is exactly what is needed. I do agree that often this is the wrong level of abstraction for many applications. The most basic problem I think of is that conversion between upper and lower case cannot be done at the code-point level. It would be great to have some higher level abstraction for text but I'm not sure what that should look like.\n\nFor what it's worth I'm using ICU behind the scenes for strings in Scala+LLVM so it could be possible to build a good abstraction on top of that.","timestamp":"2011-06-04T08:41:28.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":6}
