Sometimes the naturalization records will list things like an exact birth date and a home village, if you're lucky.  He was probably naturalized in Marquette because Houghton county is too rural.

I'm a geek and do as much as I can to automate it – but I still have to recheck it many times as subtitles get out of sync. It takes me time and the only reason I'll do it it's because netflix just arrived this month in my country and it doesn't support iOS yet. The day they are streaming  tv movies and shows on my apple tv is when I'll gladly say bye to my pirating days.\n\nI just had the same conversation with a friend about pirating iPhone apps – he isn't a geek like me, so he had someone jailbreak his iPhone to get free apps.

{"author":"hgielrehtaeh","body":"My husband and I made the switch about 8 years ago while still in college. It's second nature now. And, we both have collapsible bags we got from NPR that fold into themselves, and are about the size of a sanitary napkin (not sure how else to describe it size wise). So when we're shopping/running errands outside of grocery shopping, we keep those in the car and use them. They look just like plastic bags, so it causes less confusion. When we started using our reusables at stores other than grocery stores, people would get really confused. \n\nBut you're right... it's a bummer to not have the free plastic bags to use for trash. But, if we forget them once in a great while at the grocery store or pharmacy, we're back to being well stocked!

{"author":"blueajah","body":"My grandma 'beat' breast cancer in 2008. In 2009, I moved across the country...but while I was away, the cancer spread. It spread to her kidneys, her lungs, and eventually her spine. They removed one of her kidneys while I was out of state, and I thought everything was okay. Then we got the diagnosis on her lungs...\n\nI moved back to help her cope with the pain. I showed back up at home, almost 8 months since I had seen her last (happy and cancer free), and it took everything I had to keep me from from breaking down. She was on morphine, and could barely function through the pain. The tumors in her spine caused horrible, awful spams to go through her legs, and she'd literally *scream* because it hurt so much. \n\nMy finance and I took care of her for 3 months. We helped her to go the bathroom, change her diapers when she had an accident, help her do her exercises... her best days were measured by the times she could walk around the house. It was only around the kitchen, but we said the 'whole house', because it made her feel better and she would be *so* proud of herself. Something that would take you or me less than 45 seconds to do was a fucking daily struggle for her. She could barely walk because of the pain. \n\nThis is the woman who raised me. My mom and dad weren't there. This woman taught me about how to be a good person, how to take care of myself... how to be independent. She hated relying on others. Having us take care of her was one of the most humbling things I've ever dealt with, for us and for her. I think...I think the guilt of it eventually got to her. She was devoutly Mormon (something that we used to argue about when she was healthy), and she would watch the stake conferences on death and what happens when we die. I'm not religious, but it couldn't help but seem that it helped her feel better, like there was something she was living for... like there was something she could die for. I didn't care, I just wanted her to get *better*.\n\nShe ended up having a panic attack on the morning of my fiance's birthday. My grandfather called the ambulance... but she had had panic attacks before. When he left, my grandpa came into our room and told us that they were taking Grandma to the hospital, and that everything should be okay, and that they'd call once they found out what was going on. We got the call about an hour later... she had a heart attack in the ambulance, and they couldn't revive her.\n\nHer birthday was this Monday, the 25th. She would have been 69 this year. My birthday just ended (the 28th). I'm 22, and this is my first birthday without her. We always, *always* used to celebrate our birthdays together since they were so close. We've never *not* done it that way. \n\nI'm finally working, I'm finally out on my own, living in my own place... I hope she'd be proud of me. I miss her so much. I know she's not in pain anymore, and I have to keep reminding myself of that. The pain was the worst part. I don't care what religion you believe in, or if you believe at all... *anything* is better than the pain she went through.\n\nI know this is really long and rambling, but I've bottled everything up since her funeral... and it feels good to let it out. I'm a mess right now, but, but.. I don't know. She was my role model and seeing her like that just killed me a little inside. I never, *ever* want someone to go through what she had to go through. If you don't care about cancer patients, then you don't have a god damn soul. You haven't seen what these people go through. What their families go through. \n\nI miss her. She should have had more time left! The day she died, we got the diagnosis that her lungs were cancer free. It was just her spine left. We were so close... fucking hell, we were so *god damn* close!\n\n *Fuck* cancer. God fucking hell, fuck *everything* about it.","timestamp":"2011-07-29T02:14:54.000-07:00","score":40,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":40,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

Usually those papers will be located in the local historical society. (County, usually.) So, you need to find early books on your town, which will have clues you can go from. Once you read everything you can find about people who were important to your town, you'll be able to \"read\" the early plat maps better. When it says something like Trigg's Addition on the plat map, you'll know who Trigg was, or at least you'll be able to get somewhere with it. That Trigg was a developer, probably. A landowner who decided to develop that bit of land. He usually was the guy who named the streets when they were added to your town's land. \n\nAlso, at your historical society, you'll be able to find old realtor/development advertisements for neighborhoods. They're promotions for when your neighborhood was first developed, and they say a lot about what buildings were there first, and sometimes even who lived there. Ask your historical society people how to read census records for your neighborhood. They'll tell you what they did for a living, how many kids they had, and whether or not they had a radio.

{"author":"Haiavaha","body":"I was gonna reply with some more technical details I knew about, but when I googled to fact check, I found this instead:\n\n&gt;Over the Internet a message will often pass through several mail transfer agents to reach the recipient. Each of these has to store the message before forwarding it on, and may therefore need to impose size limits. The result is that while large attachments may succeed internally within a company or organization, they are unreliable when sending across the Internet – and for that reason sending systems often arbitrarily limit the size their users are allowed to submit. As an example, when Google's gmail service increased its arbitrary limit to 25MB it warned that: \"you may not be able to send larger attachments to contacts who use other email services with smaller attachment limits\".\n\n&gt;Email users can be puzzled by these limits because the MIME encoding adds up to 30% overhead[4] – so that a 20MB document on disk exceeds a 25MB file attachment limit.\n\n--[Wikipedia's Article on E-mail Attachments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_attachment#Size_limits)\n\nGuess that puts us both in our place.\n\nEDIT: I think your idea has some merit though. What if Gmail did preprocess your messages, replacing attachments in a sent message with secure links to the file hosted in the cloud? You could even add specific behaviors for kinds of files. What if images you attached to a message were uploaded to imgur automatically, for instance?","timestamp":"2011-09-08T23:40:53.000-07:00","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":6,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":4}

I'd start emailing some people and seeing what kind of response you get.\n\nIf this is the ancestor of your Johann, it looks like Fischerdorf is the village to know about. And googling for Fischerdorf, Dnepropetrovsk, revealed a link to [this old PDF](http://www.plettfoundation.org/Preservings/Preservings18June2001.pdf) which describes the Mennonite emigration from Russia to Canada. The name of the organization with information is the Plett Foundation. There may be some information on your grandmother from them and they're certainly worth contacting.  Fischerdorf (translated \"Fishing Village\") was a Lutheran village, according to the PDF, but not necessarily Mennonite, so there may not be much available from them, but its worth trying).\n\nGood luck! You have some challenges - Dnepropetrovsk is a city in the Ukraine, not \"South Russia\" and is pretty big. I don't see any indication that the village of Fischerdorf exists today, so it would probably have been absorbed, and any records would be in Dnepropetrovsk's records somewhere (maybe).","timestamp":"2011-01-25T14:53:03.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":2}
