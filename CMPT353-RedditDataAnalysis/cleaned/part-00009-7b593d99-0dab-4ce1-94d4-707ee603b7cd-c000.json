{"author":"DefendingMyself","body":"Ok, I first looked at these on my phone, and wasn't able to see much detail. Now that I am at my PC I need to thank you once again. Here is what I have found out from the information you sent me:\n\n* I knew John Joseph Grant's father was Joseph John Grant (Names switched), but I had no information leading me to where Joseph John was born. On the Passport application you sent me it says he was born in Cincinnati Ohio.\n\n* I knew John Joseph was married before he married my Great Grandmother, but had no information on her. In the Passport app it says her name was Edith and she was born in England.\n\n* I found he John Joseph was an auto mechanic in 1921, that must have been an interesting job back then.\n\n* This was the first time I have ever seen a picture of John Joseph Grant, so that was pretty interesting.\n\nThe above info was all from the passport application, which has the correct birth place and birth date, as well as the correct fathers name. It also has the same signature that he signed my great grandmothers death certificate with in 1967, so I feel it is safe to say this is him.\n\nThe second piece you gave me:\n\n* Same name, same birth date and location (very small town), so I am pretty confident this one is him.\n\n* this one gives a great deal of information regarding his service in WWI. Including that he spent 513 days at sea and 71 days in whatever COX is. It gives the info that he was Hon Discharged Oct 1, 1919. I don't understand most of the info on this but it looks like it may contain dates of service including a discharge in 1917 and a reenlistment the next day.\n\n* Found his service number: 161 64 79 on the next two images, and again the COX word, this time under \"Rating at date of last report\". Also the second one says COX(V-6)\n\nThen you added his draft card, which I had found with the free access.\n\nI cannot say enough how thankful I am for your help!\n","timestamp":"2011-12-04T22:40:18.000-08:00","score":2,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":2,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}

The land he owned was given to him by his father-in-law, who was a prominent and wealthy founder of the town. What he owned was sold to people unrelated to him.  There was no will when he passed.\n\n* He actually was married to the founder of his church, and is buried in the cemetery adjacent to it, as are most of his descendents.  Unfortunately, the church burnt down and has no records that would be of use.  It's as if he just appeared out of thin air in 1849 when he married his wife.  She was a local girl though, born and raised in that area, which leads me to believe he had to have been there for at least a little while before the marriage in order to have met and courted here.   \n\n* He was a farmer and later, an elected tax assesor for his township.

I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by \n            setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I \n            couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load \n            (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically \n            vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.\"\n        alt=\"Let Go\" /&gt;\nSo we have the \"title\" field and the \"alt\" field. But wait! There's more!\n\n    &lt;div id=\"titleHolder\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1 id=\"title\"&gt;Let Go&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;sup id=\"altTextLink\"&gt;(alt-text)\n    &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;p id=\"altText\"&gt;After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by \n    pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the \n    neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, \n    in which I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything else, before any new page or chat client \n    would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those \n    sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was \n    unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\nSo we see that the \"alt-text\" or \"altText\" field is the actual \"alt-text.\" However, when the image is loaded, the \"alt\" and \"title\" fields are as you state. When we refer to \"alt-text\" we are referring to the larger piece of text usually containing an extra joke found in the image tooltip (at the normal site). The HTML refers to title and alt differently, but these are not the same as the alt-text. So you are in fact being downvoted correctly as you are not 100% correct.","timestamp":"2011-02-18T08:19:30.000-08:00","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":4,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"AgentConundrum","body":"Basically you're trying to make it as hard as possible for someone to get to a users password. If one security measure is compromised, there are others that will still at least slow them down.\n\nA good service will only allow you to try &lt;small-n&gt; passwords before either locking you out or at least throttling your attempts, but it's still possible that someone will accidentally concatenate a part of a query when they should have prepared a statement, and suddenly its possible to query the users/passwords table directly.\n\nWhen this happens, you want to make sure that your passwords are all hashed so that they aren't immediately usable by the attacker. To prevent using a precomputed rainbow table, you'll want to use a unique hash on every password. To slow down the generation of rainbow tables to decrypt these uniquely-hashed passwords, you want to use a slow hashing algorithm (bcrypt seems to be standard here) since taking an extra 100ms on your server to check one password is trivial, but those 100s of ms will quickly add up to a non-trivial time for an attacker.\n\nIt's all about reinforcing yourself with multiple layers of security, rather than putting all your eggs into one basket. If you discover you've been compromised, you want to keep your users passwords (which some subset of users will most assuredly have used elsewhere) as safe as possible for as long as possible, so that you can inform them of the breach in time for them to change any other potentially compromised passwords.","timestamp":"2011-08-10T14:37:42.000-07:00","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":4,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

A Gold Minė for African Amėrican Rėsėarchėrs (and not just Virginia Rėsėarchėrs).\n\nIt is incorrėct to say that thosė who wėrė ėnslavėd arė not in thė rėcords prior April 1865 and thė ėnd of thė Civil War and thė gėnėral ėmancipation, look at any county court rėcord whėrė “propėrty” is listėd wills, dėėds, wė arė thėrė…but thosė ėnslavėd individuals do not spėak for thėmsėlvės….in thėsė FB Rėcords many of thė pėoplė wė sėėk “Spėak for Thėmsėlvės”... givė thėir namės, thėir childrėn’s namės, wivės, go to court, makė labor contracts, complain about thėir trėatmėnt as Frėė Mėn and Womėn, ask for transport back to thėir homės aftėr thėy had run to Union hėld tėrritory in VA to contraband camps, marry, takė a cėnsus…too many othėr things for mė to mėntion.\nIn 1993 Jamės Walkėr [http://www.aagsnc.org/articlės/walkėr.htm](http://www.aagsnc.org/articlės/walkėr.htm), co-foundėr of AAHGS and Archivist at thė National Archivės had spokėn to our AAHGS Chaptėr about thė historical valuė and thė immėnsė wėalth of information of thėsė rėcords and implorėd us to go and sėė thėm. A couplė of months latėr I did havė an opportunity to sėė somė of thėm. Thėy wėrė not microfilmėd and in thėir original statė, I was ovėrwhėlmėd. In thė ėarly 2000’s thėsė rėcords wėrė microfilmėd.

Many of us wėrė inspirėd to work on that ėffort. It was finally complėtė in 2008. It has takėn awhilė but it is finally On-Linė. I know you all want to know how to gėt to thė rėcords but I did think that it is important that thosė pėoplė and thėrė arė many othėrs, who undėrstood thė immėnsė valuė of thėsė rėcords for family rėsėarchėrs, historians, bė rėmėmbėrėd and givėn crėdit.

There is no surer way to prevent progress than to presume you already have the best possible answer\n\n&gt;Any alternative will be more likely to make mistakes, as they can't possibly have as much information as a system that includes all humans as decision makers\n\nIf that were true, I would be inclined to agree with you, but everything I have seen indicates that as few people as possible are involved in exchanging information.  That is, partly I believe, at the heart of the 99% protests, most of us realize we have no input into how the system runs itself.\n\nAnd if you're going to shoot back with \"Well, that's not really a free market\" I'm going to have to ask you to provide some real world examples of free markets.\n\n&gt;BTW I appreciate you having a civil debate with me and not using ad-hominems. That's hard to come by these days.\n\nAnytime :) there are plenty of reasonable people in the world if you look carefully\n\n&gt;it seems your argument boils down to \"Sometimes the market will not naturally do things that I want to see happen.\"\n\nNot exactly, I would say it's something closer to \"Often the market actively suppresses human improvement and well-being in favor of short term profits.  It should be monitored, well tended, and used only where it stands to improve the lives of all humans\".  \n\n\"The Market\" is my favorite example of a hammer, an excellent tool, but when it's the only one you use every problem starts to look like a nail.","timestamp":"2011-10-12T08:26:14.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}
