{"author":"petervanroy","body":"Yes, we were very impressed by the modularity and good design of nsc.  It's what made the Ozma project possible.  What Ozma offers is **declarative concurrency**.  The point is to make it as easy as possible for Scala programmers (and maybe some Java programmers too?) to understand this and see why it enormously simplifies concurrent programming.  It's much better than Java's synchronized objects (monitors).  Ozma integrates declarative concurrency with message passing (using ports), and this is the best form of concurrent programming I know of.  We had to add ports to Ozma because it was not possible to integrate declarative concurrency with Scala's existing message passing model.","timestamp":"2011-06-27T01:11:08.000-07:00","score":1,"subreddit":"scala","ups":1,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":1}

{"author":"akinger","body":"I've always been interested in my history. My grandma has always told me a lot about our family, and I guess I came into it naturally. \r\n\r\nWhen I was in first year university, I had to spend time in the language lab for my foreign language courses. I got bored one day, and decided to google my great-grandfather's name (mum's mum's dad). Because his name is rather unique, I found a link to a family tree that someone had created. It had a fair amount of information on it, going back to 1780. I also searched my other great-grandfather's name (dad's mum's dad, also a unique name) and found one for that branch of my family going back to 1781. \r\n\r\nSince then, it's been a real hobby of mine to go back as far as possible. Using ancestry.com I was able to trace my maternal grandpa's family back to 1360, after they came to the UK with the Norman conquest. \r\n\r\nPart of my family is from Newfoundland. Most Newfies I've met have an inherent interest in the history of their family. The most common thing I heard in Newfoundland was \"What is your family's surname?\", as there are several main names on the island that go back generations.\r\n\r\nAnother part of my family is Australian, but they came to Australia from Prussia during the 1830's gold rush. I've desperately wanted to find more about them, but I've so far been unable to do so. My paternal grandmother's maiden name has no German meaning, leading me to believe that it is a Germanized form of a foreign name, possibly Polish.","timestamp":"2011-01-21T09:37:05.000-08:00","score":3,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":3,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

If you find someone who is researching the same people as you, don't be afraid to contact them. If you are willing to share the information you have, they are usually willing to reciprocate. Always be sure to ask them if they don't want you disseminating the information they provide you (some people don't-- copyright can be a big deal for some people). When you give information to others, try to let them know your sources. If the fact you are sharing isn't sourced, be sure to let them know that as well. The passing on of false information, even inadvertently, is one of the challenges that has been raised in modern genealogy research.

I get the impression that “simple” seems rather lower-hanging fruit for me than for you — to someone with a background in C, I think it would be easier to explain (say) Java or Python than Scala.\n\nTo someone coming straight out of Java, without considerable experience in other languages, would you rather explain the intricacies behind Scala's implicits — their use, their resolution, the implications for API design — or Kotlin's extension methods? Further: It is undeniable that beginners are taken aback in first attempts to understand Scala’s collection library, a thing of beauty but *certainly* more complex than the Java-like libraries that Kotlin will probably sport.

The only difference is that field accesses might be slightly faster than method invocations, because the field values are pre-computed when the class is initialized, instead of being computed on each method call. On the other hand, the fields require extra memory space in each Element object. So it depends on the usage profile of a class whether an attribute is better represented as a field or method, and that usage profile might change over time. The point is that clients of the Element class should not be affected when its internal implementation changes.\n\nSo like SeriousWorm &amp; the comment on that site said, it can be a useful feature.","timestamp":"2011-04-27T18:24:15.000-07:00","score":2,"subreddit":"scala","ups":2,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":3}

What a model gives us, in many cases at least, that an experiment does not is insight into what bits are causing what we see.  The rubber sheet analogy is pretty deeply flawed (it better reflects the century of geometric approaches that failed before Einstein's than it does the successful theory), but the dots on a balloon, for example, can illustrate that \"everything goes away from everything\" isn't some spooky thing that comes out of geometrodynamics -- it's a general feature found in anything that expands everywhere.","timestamp":"2011-05-06T08:50:23.000-07:00","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":3,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

{"author":"rnelsonee","body":"&gt;What is the reason banks use what seems like the least secure password policies of all websites?\n\n\nSupport of legacy systems -- namely phone systems -- is the main reason. Banks and other big institutions were the first to get on the whole customer account access train and that first-adopter status is now hurting them because it's too expensive to overhaul their systems. \n\nWhen these systems went up, they had users log in with the medium at the time, which was over touch-tone phones, which was limited of course to alphanumerics. I remember when phones didn't even have a \"Q\" or \"Z\" on them, but that had to change when you could start looking up things like stock symbols, which were created without regard to phone-keypad-letter availability. And this was before the internet, so passwords over 6 or 8 characters didn't seem necessary.\n\nI noticed this after Fidelity made me use no special characters in my password. I realized why when I went to call them about a question... and had to key in my password. If my password had special characters in it, I wouldn't have known what number to press.\n\nLooking at all of my accounts online, the four that don't allow special characters all have phone support (financial institutions and a utility company). But since a place like Dropbox or Gmail won't ever have you call them and manage your account over the phone, they can have strong passwords.","timestamp":"2011-10-28T06:00:21.000-07:00","score":8,"subreddit":"xkcd","ups":8,"daytype":"weekday","day_of_week":5}

So it's common to find such ethnocentric tendencies in maps. For example, world maps in the States tend to be centered on either the Prime Meridian (itself an example of English ethnocentrism) or the USA. A map I bought in Singapore shows east Asia front and center. \n\nSo it's not surprising that maps from Australia show Australia in the middle. \n\nThese biases even turn in in digital maps and globes, which aren't limited in the same way as paper maps.

{"author":"Brmcbrewer","body":"I have a lot of faith in Reddit but I see your point... For now I'm keeping my hopes up and remaining optimistic instead of letting this get the better of me.  My grandfather is battling cancer right now and I kind of wanted to help him discover his roots before it gets too late.  I hear these stories about 20 year long searches for that one clue to break through a wall and I don't want that to be me.\n\nAs for the siblings, John Walter McDonnell had two children; my Grandfather and his older sister.  They were 10 &amp; 13 when their father passed away and their Mother died in the seventies.  Unfortunately it seems that any information I am going to find will be through documents or I'm hoping the DNA results.  His daughter did say that she thought he kept in contact with his sister periodically.  The only papers that seem to have been kept of his though were the voter registration card and his original social security card.  I will be searching again through an old antique trunk that had piles of letters from funerals.  Maybe there will be a letter from his sister after his passing?  Thank you so much for the idea (I'll also try to track down some neighbors).  Take care and enjoy the holidays!","timestamp":"2011-11-27T17:38:03.000-08:00","score":1,"subreddit":"Genealogy","ups":1,"daytype":"weekend","day_of_week":7}
